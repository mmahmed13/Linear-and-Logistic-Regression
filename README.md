# Linear-and-Logistic-Regression

This is a simple implementation of Linear Regression with one variable and Logistic Regression with and without Regularization. This was done as part of Machine Learning Assignment on Coursera.

To run Linear Regression that predict profits for a food truck, run ex1.m which will load data from ex1data1.txt. In that file, The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

To run Logistic Regression without Regularization that determines a student's chance of getting admission in a university based on his
results on two exams, run ex2.m which will load training data from ex2data1.m

To run Logistic Regression with Regularization that predicts whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance, run ex2_reg.m . We have a dataset of 2 test results in ex2data2.m on past microchips, from which we can build a logistic regression model.
